Tagging Feature Implementation Instructions

    Allow users to add multiple tags to a note during both creation and editing.

    Provide a clear, accessible input field or token field with placeholder text like “Add tag…” and optionally a plus (+) icon to invite tag creation.

    Support free text entry: when users type a tag name that doesn’t exist, allow creation of a new tag by pressing Enter or an explicit "Add" action.

    Convert each added tag into a visually distinct token or pill-shaped badge that can be easily recognized and managed.

    Show autocomplete suggestions dropdown as users type, enabling quick selection from existing tags to prevent duplicates.

    Support multi-select from autocomplete suggestions so users can add multiple existing tags in one interaction.

    Tags can be grouped hierarchically if needed, using a "group:tag" naming convention to organize tags (optional).

    Allow tags to be removed or edited by tapping a small “x” or delete icon on each token.

    Ensure consistent tag management across note creation and editing interfaces.

    Assign distinct colors or visual styles to tags for quick identification.

    Provide optional descriptions or metadata visible on hover or tap for better tag context (optional).

    Ensure smooth keyboard and touch interaction with accessible focus states and screen reader support.

    Reflect changes immediately in the note’s tag display area, allowing users to see all applied tags at a glance.

    Avoid duplicate tags by restricting entry of exact matches of existing tags.

    Facilitate tag filtering and organization in broader app views if applicable.
