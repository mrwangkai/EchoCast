| Task | Details | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1. Fix note card styling (200x200px, padding 16px, tags 8px top padding) | • Updated HomeNoteCardView dimensions from 280x320 to 200x200 • Changed padding from 20px to 16px • Set tags padding-top to 8px • Fixed tag colors to match SVG design (Color #CCC2FF) • Adjusted corner radius from 16 to 8 • Fixed note text to 4 line limit with proper spacing | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 2. Fix View All card alignment | • Added alignment: .top to HStack containing note cards • Updated View All card dimensions from 280x320 to 200x200 • Changed corner radius from 16 to 8 to match note cards | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 3. Fix View All navigation (card & link to Notes tab) | • Changed View All card from NavigationLink to Button with selectedTab = 2 • Changed "view all" link from NavigationLink to Button with selectedTab = 2 • Both now properly navigate to Notes tab instead of separate screen | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 4. Apply SF Pro Rounded font to all text styles | • Applied .font(.system(size: 22, weight: .bold, design: .rounded)) to all section headers: - "Recently Played" (line 434) - "Recent Notes" (line 462) - "My Podcasts" (lines 395, 1158) • HomeNoteCardView uses SF Pro Rounded for all text elements • Tags use size 11, note text size 17, episode title size 13, series name size 11 | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 5. Fix header alignment (page & section headers) | • Updated all section headers to use consistent padding: - .padding(.leading, 20) and .padding(.trailing, 16) • This matches iOS navigation title standard padding • Applied to: Recently Played, Recent Notes, My Podcasts sections | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 6. Remove white space below notes card section on Notes tab | • Not addressed - requires investigation of Notes tab layout • May need to adjust VStack spacing or remove extra padding | ⚠️ NOT COMPLETED |
| 7. Fix delete interaction (card stays until confirmation) | • Not addressed - requires changing delete confirmation flow • Current behavior shows alert which temporarily hides card • Needs to prevent card disappearance until user confirms deletion | ⚠️ NOT COMPLETED |
| 8. Remove "Downloaded" indicator below episodes on Podcasts tab | • Removed downloaded indicator at line 1541-1550 (HStack with icon + text) • Removed downloaded indicator at line 1590-1594 (Label component) • Episodes no longer show green "Downloaded" badge | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 9. Remove "Import OPML" link from My Podcasts section | • Removed entire HStack containing "Import OPML" button (lines 1157-1170) • Simplified My Podcasts header to just the title with proper padding • Button and associated showOPMLImport action removed from UI | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 10. Fix Home tab navigation (return to Home from Notes view) | • Fixed by changing View All navigation to use selectedTab = 2 • Tapping Home tab now properly returns to Home view • Previous NavigationLink was creating separate navigation stack • Now uses tab selection which properly resets view hierarchy | ✅ SUCCESS |

Notes on Incomplete Items:

6 - White space on Notes tab: This requires examining the Notes tab's ScrollView/VStack structure to identify and remove excess spacing or padding. This is a layout investigation task.

7 - Delete confirmation interaction: This requires modifying the confirmation alert behavior, possibly using a custom confirmation sheet or changing the delete flow to prevent the card from visually disappearing before confirmation.
