Implement Apple Music-style mini player with full-screen expansion

FEATURES:
- Apple Music-style persistent mini player overlay above tab bar
- Blur material background with progress indicator
- Album artwork, episode info, and playback controls
- Drag-up gesture to expand to full screen
- Full-screen player with chevron dismiss button
- Smooth spring animations for all transitions
- Mini player persists across tab navigation

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- New AppleMusicStyleMiniPlayer component in ContentView.swift
- Uses ZStack to position above TabView (not in safe area)
- .fullScreenCover for true modal full-screen player
- Progress bar overlay shows playback position
- Three control buttons: Add Note, Play/Pause, Skip Forward 15s
- Mint accent color throughout for consistency

TECHNICAL:
- Mini player: 64pt height + rounded top corners
- Ultra-thin material blur (iOS native)
- Custom drag gesture recognizer with threshold
- Proper state management via GlobalPlayerManager
- RoundedCorner shape helper for custom corner radius

UX:
- Tap anywhere on mini player → expand to full screen
- Drag up → expand to full screen  
- Swipe down on full player → minimize
- Tab bar remains visible (matches Apple Music pattern)

This matches the iOS Human Interface Guidelines for persistent media players
and provides a familiar, intuitive user experience.
